# Changelog

## v0.7.1 - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- Fixed `run.boss_id` in the Mod `/state` payload so active runs now expose the current act boss ID instead of returning `null`.
- Switched boss resolution to `RunState.Act.BossEncounter.Id.Entry` with a compatibility fallback for older runtime layouts.

## v0.7.0 - 2026-04-30

### Highlights

- Multiplayer AI control is now release-ready for the main play loop.
- Rest-site `MEND` now works in multiplayer without hanging the HTTP request.
- Multiplayer validation and startup scripts were hardened for repeatable release testing.

### Added

- Rest-site options now expose `requires_target`, `target_index_space`, and `valid_target_indices` so AI clients can resolve multiplayer-only targets correctly.
- Map payloads now expose local and remote vote state, including per-node vote counts and voter IDs.
- Multiplayer validation now covers lobby setup, intro resolution, combat progression, rewards, and multiplayer `MEND` target handling.

### Changed

- `choose_rest_option` now accepts `target_index` for targetable rest actions such as multiplayer `MEND`.
- The PowerShell startup flow now waits for both `/health` and `/state` and prints progress while the game boots.
- Release packaging now includes the changelog alongside the packaged mod and MCP server files.

### Fixed

- Fixed host multiplayer map voting so local votes register correctly instead of being lost on the first click.
- Fixed multiplayer map state visibility so both sides can inspect local votes, remote votes, and node vote counts.
- Fixed multiplayer `MEND` so missing `target_index` returns an immediate structured `invalid_target` error instead of timing out.
- Fixed multiplayer validation timing issues around lobby modals, intro transitions, combat readiness, and turn rollover.
- Fixed the PowerShell multiplayer test harness so it no longer relies on brittle redirected child shells to start game sessions.

### Compatibility

- Verified against Slay the Spire 2 `v0.103.2`.
- Mod health endpoint reports protocol version `2026-03-11-v1`.

### Known limitations

- A host-side debug `room RestSite` jump can still fail after multiplayer reward resolution because of the base game's combat sync state. This does not block normal AI-driven multiplayer play and is treated as a debug-only limitation during release validation.

## v0.6.1 - 2026-04-25

### Highlights

- Added live `/data/*` export endpoints for cards, relics, monsters, potions, events, powers, and characters.
- Switched MCP game-data lookup to the live Mod API with in-process caching.
- Improved error handling for game-data tools and synchronized the MCP tool profile coverage.
